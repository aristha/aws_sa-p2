Cost estimates
Initial cost estimate - 9,404.33 USD / month
Reduced estimate - 6,496.30 USD / month
Reduced instance size of web and app servers to t3.medium, and increased the limit of autoscaling group. Performance will be affected, but this will allow for more granular autoscaling
Reduced the instance size of RDS postgres instances.
Used 1 year standard reserved instances for servers and RDS. This makes sense since we won't be re-architecting the app much.
Increased estimate - 19,694.38 USD / month
Added a secondary region for more redundancy and better performance. Web and app servers are of same type in both regions, but the secondary region only has a Multi-AZ read replica which is updated from the primary main DB.
Increased server instance sizes for better performance
Servers in secondary region can write to the primary main DB through VPC peering
